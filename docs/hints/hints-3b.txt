It's another small multiples! This means multiple g elements, transform/translate and an .each to loop through
































Of course that also means d3.select(this) inside of the each to gain access to the g element you're going to be putting things inside of.























And of course examine 'd' inside of the each statement to remind yourself where your city name is and where your data elements actually are.






























You'll probably want to make the radius smaller so everything fits.


























The kind of scale you use to space everything out is going to run your circles off of the page. You can also add a padding(0) to the scale to add padding near the elements on the edges - padding can be from 0 to 1, so experiment with the values that look the best.




























Even though you need a label for every country, because you have the nested/g thing going you can just do an .append and it will give you one for each g element.
