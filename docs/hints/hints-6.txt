It's really almost the same as what you've been doing with the tempearture ones. Start from there.














Fill in the center of the radar chart shape, and make sure it has a stroke, too!












When you put in the stroke, you'll notice something seems a little wrong. One of the segments is missing! How can you fix that? How can you make the last point connect to the first point?



















To draw the lines going out in each direction, first: you'll need a line for each category (yes, an actual line, not a path)











Lines go from x1, y1 to x2, y2.











Start by drawing lines that go from the CENTER to the TOP of your chart. All of the lines! Right on top of each other!

















Can you rotate them around the center?













Perhaps a little transform + rotate?
















You'll use the angleScale combined with the name of the category to figure out how much to rotate it
















Remember your angleScale gives results in radians, and rotate needs degrees! The formula (not in proper JavaScript) is:

      (radians / pi) * 180
















If yours are going in the MIDDLE of each category, go back to the 'make every line go from the CENTER to the TOP'. Yours probably went from the center to the bottom!















For the text, it's the same thing - you want one for each category. Position them all at the top, then spin them around with transform/rotate.
