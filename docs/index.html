      <h1>Your Lightbulb May Be Spying On You:</h1>

    <h1>A Data Driven Investigation into the World of Smart Lightbulbs</h1>

    <p>Zachary Elkwood</p>

      <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <b>Overview:</b>
        <p>In a perfect world, every app and brand would have an easy to find Privacy Policy or Permissions List that clearly laid out exactly what data their product takes in. In the smart bulb sphere, these documents are often ambiguous, inapplicable, or inaccessible.</p>
        <p>A Privacy Policy on one brand’s site may not even cover the bulbs they are selling, rather limiting itself only to the website’s operations and providing the consumer with no or misleading information. Some are even silent as to what products and services the policy covers.</p>
        <p><strong>Of the Smart Lightbulbs Sampled for This Study:</strong></p>
        <p>Slightly over <strong>1 in 3</strong> lightbulbs had an accessible and readable Privacy Policy. <strong>Less than half</strong> of those had any mention of the last time they were updated.</p>
        <p>Out of the 37 total apps related to the sampled bulbs, only <strong>25</strong> had Privacy Policies discoverable on the Apple or Google App Stores.</p>
        <p>Even if a Privacy Policy on a given brand’s site or app is available, there is little guarantee that it will be enforced and accurate. On top of that ambiguity, is the fact that a great deal of legal language muddies the waters. These policies are replete with ambiguous terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Almost half</strong> of the sampled policies included the phrase “May Use” in their section detailing what Personal Data the brand collects.</p>
        <p><strong>Above half</strong> of the sampled policies used the term “May Contain” at least once. <strong>14</strong> of those used the phrase over three times.</p>

    <p>Hackers and bad actors are counting on consumers not imagining lightbulbs as vulnerable honeypots of personal information. Bulbs are cheap, ubiquitous, and seemingly harmless, which is why they are an unsuspecting ground for malfeasance. It also doesn’t take a tech genius to crack into one. Smart bulbs are low hanging fruit for hackers, dangling just above our heads every day.  </p>
    <p>The basic guards you have from these predations are full of holes, as we discovered when we surveyed the smart bulb market with a computer assisted analysis of Amazon’s top brands. Manufacturers can provide voluminous detail on the steps it takes to make sure that devices do not collect data from you that they should not. However, many just don’t and many others use language so ambiguous it is pointless.</p>
    <p><strong><i>“If you drive and you do not respect the rules, you will be punished. In IoT ecosystem, there are no rules, so you can imagine how many bad drivers exist.”</i></strong><a href="https://limitedresults.com/2019/01/pwn-the-lifx-mini-white/"> ,said Limited Results</a> a hacker with 10 years of experience investigating household devices.</p>
    <p>Smart lightbulbs- any lightbulb that connects to the internet- are part of what tech insiders refer to as The Internet of Things (IoT). These devices are linked to the internet, usually through a mobile app, to provide some type of added functionality. Changing color, turning on and off with a phone, or playing music are all popular add-ons. Though, with each added role they become more susceptible and valuable to hackers. </p>

    <p>The influx of smart functionality in household products is a dangerous fad. Product makers slap on smart labels as a siren for unsuspecting consumers looking for the most cutting-edge version of a product. As the data piles up in a smart device, the precocious object becomes more difficult to control. The many manufacturers who hastily inject internet functionality into items often times do not plan for or consider the vast security implications consumers may face.</p>
    <p><strong><i>“There is no US federal requirement for IoT devices to be secured, so many simply aren't."</i>,</strong><a href="https://about.me/snubs"> said Shannon Morse</a>, host of TekThing and Threat Wire; Hak5 and HakTip via Discovery Digital Networks.</p>
    <p></p>Amazon.com provides a microcosm of the IoT landscape. Underinformed consumers buy smart products from underprepared and rushed sellers. Amazon.com is swimming with almost identical smart bulbs, sold by a revolving door of unknown brands. Searching the term, “smart light bulb” on Amazon.com yields over <strong>1,000</strong> results. Searching from the “Top Brands” yields <strong>50</strong>. A deeper dive into a sampling of these devices reveals an unknown world of cross-border marketing and consumer disinformation.</p>



<div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
        <h2>Part II. Where Do Bulbs Go Bad?</h2>
        <h3><font color ="red">Hardware</h3></font>
        <p>A significant proportion of IoT products stem from overseas manufacturers who are merely attempting to hitch a ride onto the IoT upswing and are disconnected from the customer base. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Many of these companies don’t have any interest in having a long-term relationship with their customers. They are dumping cheap products online, people are buying them, that is the end of the relationship.”</i></strong><a href="https://securityledger.com/"> ,said Paul Roberts</a>, founder and Editor in Chief of The Security Ledger, an independent security news website that explores the intersection of cyber security with the Internet of Things.</p>
        <p>The IoT landscape shrouds consumers in a perpetual fog of technological jargon and little oversight.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“The IoT market is not wholly different than any other market. There is certainly plenty of opportunity for abuse. If there is a market with lax oversite, and low controls, and low level of consumer knowledge on this issues it’s easy to scam people to sell them garbage products.”</i></strong>, said Roberts</p>
        <p>Consumers do not put security at the forefront of their concerns, so product manufacturers tend to ignore these factors as well. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Many IoT products are built to be convenient and easy to use for a regular consumer, which makes security a low priority for the company developing the product. Since security of a product is not a high priority, it also gets a lower amount of financial backing. And without financial backing, a team working on the security of the device isn't possible or is pressed with deadlines.”</i></strong>, said Morse.</p>

        <h3><font color ="red">Software</h3></font>
        <p>The same quick-fix mentality for hardware also leaks into software development. The apps necessary to utilize these bulbs are another virtual minefield.</p>
      
        <h3><font color="red">How Many Smart Bulbs Came with Apps?</h3></font>
        <img src="./data/Listed_Apps.png" alt="Listed Apps"  class="center">
        <p></p>
        <p><strong><i>“There just is a lack of attention to security and quality and often the apps and other features the software that is being built on top of this developers will literally copy and paste sample code from the manufacturer.”</i></strong>,said Roberts. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>This fact is evident from the fact that <strong>over half</strong> of the bulbs suggested the user download either the  “Smart Life App” or  “Magic Home App”. </p>
        
        <h3><font color='red'>How Many Apps Suggested "Smart Life"?</h3></font>
        <img src="./data/Smart-Life_Apps.png" alt="Smart Life Apps"  class="center">

        <h3><font color='red'>The Shenzen Connection</h3></font>
        <p>Famous manufacturers of pre-IoT bulbs like Philips may ring a bell, but there are countless unknown brands littering the Amazon.com smart bulb sales page. These new devices can generally be traced back to one region in China that has dominated the IoT market. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“The driving force there[China] is getting products on the shelves”</i></strong>,said Roberts. </p>
        <p>The majority of the bulbs in this study came from a brands that registered a trademark with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USTPO). <strong>64%</strong>of these brands were registered to a Chinese company.</p>
        <div id="chart-2"></div>
        <h3><font color='red'>How Many Apps Came From China?</h3></font>
        <img src="./data/China.png" alt="China"  class="center">
        <p><strong><i>“The supply chain for any consumer electronics maker in the US starts in China. Very few components are manufactured in the US”</i></strong>,said Roberts. </p>
        <p>The dominance of these Chinese products in Amazon’s store is two-fold. These Chinese companies have the business flexibility to produce cheaper goods in a variety of electronic categories and the massive amount of products sold on Amazon can mask malfeasance for a short time. While Amazon deploys numerous safeguards to make sure that these types of goods are removed, some working in the industry believe there are many that slip through the cracks. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Though I’m solely a domestic originator/seller, to my knowledge, there is no formalized vetting process for international sellers selling in the US (the EU is a different story; tons of red tape) that I’m aware of. International sellers only need a domestic bank account and unique email address to set up an account and start selling.”</i></strong>, said <a href="https://www.klybee.com/"> Nicholas Klaiber</a>, President of the e-commerce branding firm, Klybee.<p>
        <p>Amazon’s policies towards international sellers have been especially potent in sparking Chinese competition. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Specifically, Chinese sellers can syndicate cheaper goods and undercut domestic based sellers selling a product that is not gated/protected by its trademark. The only ‘vetting’ that Amazon deploys is on the backend once customer complaints are received. If the customer complains that the purchased product feels like a knock-off, Amazon will then delete the listing and reprimand the seller.”</i></strong>, said Klaiber.</p>
        <p>Almost <strong>80%</strong> of the bulbs registered to Chinese companies were registered from Shenzen, China. While the region’s name may be unfamiliar to some, the area has been the powerhouse of second tier electronics for the past few years. </p>
        <h3><font color='red'>How Many Products were Registered in Shenzen?</font></h3>
        <img src="./data/Shenzen.png" alt="Shenzen"  class="center">
        <p>In <i><a href= "https://aisuperpowers.com/" >AI-Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</a></i> former Google China President, Dr. Kai-Fu Lee discussed the prominence of Shenzen in the world of electronics manufacturing.</p>
        <p>In the past five years, the southern coastal Chinese city became a hardware haven for new computer devices. There is a strong network of manufacturers and suppliers that allow this region to grow.  The area's markets and factories allow for items to be made modularly and quickly.</p>
        <p>Around <strong>half</strong> of the bulbs sampled on Amazon were registered in the past <strong>three years</strong>.</p>

        <img src="./data/Filing-Dates.png" alt="Filing Dates"  class="center">

        <h3><font color='red'>Hardware</h3></font>
        <p><strong><i>“China is where there is an ecosystem of parts makers”</i></strong>,said Roberts.</p>
        <p>The proximity and abundance of electronic devices in these overseas areas leads to a lack of variety among products and software. If one piece of technology is vulnerable to hacking, it is likely that many other share the same design- and flaw.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“When you peel back the covers of a story about a vulnerable webcam, home router, digital video recorder, smart watch, often what you find is a short list of companies that make let's say cameras in China and make them for many many manufacturers and companies and often the firmware that they are using, the hardware that they are using is the same.”</i></strong>, said Roberts.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“It’s almost like a salmonella outbreak or something. If you have a remotely exploitable vulnerability with their firmware made by a firm in China that basically supplies 2/3 of the webcams out there it will be a pretty widespread problem.”</i></strong>, said Roberts.</p>
        <p>Though tracing back these problems and placing the blame is exceedingly difficult to trace.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“If we buy our lettuce from Mexico and there is a Salmonella outbreak in California is that a Mexican Salmonella outbreak our Mexico?”</i></strong>, asked Roberts.</p>

        <h2>Part III. How Hacking into Bulbs Works</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="./data/The-Data-Drip.png" alt="The Data Drip" class="center">
        <figcaption><i>Botnets are groups of computers overtaken by a third party and usually forced into malicious behavior</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>IoT items like smart bulbs are a stepping stone to one’s personal and valuable information. The true threat to users comes from the lightbulb’s connection to an intricate mesh of one’s digital universe.</p>
        <p>There is not one vulnerability that sets a bulb apart from another. No matter where the hole in the ship is, it will spring a devastating leak.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“Any vulnerability are the worst vulnerability. Not that easy to evaluate them.”</i></strong>, said Yier Jin Associate Professor, University of Florida, Endowed IoT Term Professor and Academic Director, Warren B. Nelms Institute for the Connected World.</p>
        <p>There is no <i>worst</i> vulnerability in a smart bulb because any opening has around the same possibility for damage.</p>

        <h3><font color='red'>Wi-Fi</h3></font>
        <p>Smart functionality can not work on just the bulb. To engage in activity beyond the scope of a normal lightbulb, the device must be connected to a cell-phone and Wi-Fi, two spaces where a trove of vulnerable data lies. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Smart Light Bulbs will be an “Access” point to the Wi-Fi of the house/office and after that it’s an open field, let me remind you of the famous case of hacking a Las Vegas hotel using Fish Tank because it was connected to the Wi-Fi .”</i></strong>,said <a href="http://generalengineering.sjsu.edu/faculty/ahmed-banafa/">  Ahmed Banafa</a>, IoT Expert and Professor at  Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering
          San Jose State University.</p>
        <p>Wi-Fi access is a gateway towards stored files, any other devices connected to Wi-Fi, and control of one’s network.</p>

        <h3><font color='red'>Apps</h3></font>
        <p>Smart bulbs also generally use phone apps to control the devices. The number of apps that these devices suggest using is staggering and fluctuate wildly in quality.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“Also, if the app of the smart light bulb [is] compromised you can access the smartphone, and own it with all the info in that phone apps (banks, e-mails, amazon...etc.)”, </i></strong>said Banafa.</p>
        <p>Nearly <strong>15%</strong> of the sampled bulbs had no listed applications on their website or Amazon Seller page. Consumers are forced into the wilds of the Appstore to navigate a thicket of privacy snatching programs. </p>
       
        <p></p>
        <p>One refuge on the Android App Store is the fact that each listed app lays out the data permissions required from users. Permissions are the various aspects of the phone data an app needs to function. When an app states it has Permission for one item, it means that it can access that item on your phone once the App is downloaded</p>
        <p>The three most commonly requested permissions for smart bulbs were <strong> Permission to Photos/Media/Files</strong>, <strong>Permission to Storage</strong>, and <strong>Permission to Location</strong>.</p>
        <p>On average, the sampled lightbulb controlling apps required <strong>7</strong> different data permission categories from a user. These permission categories are placed in large bins that each contain more specific information about what an app captures, further obscuring the data they hold. </p>
       
        <h2>Part IV. What Consumers Can Do </h2>
        <p>On a high level, there is very little that consumers can do to protect themselves from these types of vulnerabilities. The world is flooded with internet connected devices and its unrealistic to shun all of them. Larger technical issues are too complex and fast moving for one too understand fully. However, there are  a number of red flags one can look out for.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“One of the problems is to think that consumers are really in a position to make decisions like this. It’s like when Ford Pintos were blowing up from rear end collisions. When Ford cheaped out. Well what tips can you give to car buyers? Consumers are not in a position to make that judgment."</i></strong>, said Roberts.</p>
        <p>Users can follow a few steps to insulate themselves from damage.</p>
        <p>The first step would be a basic eye test.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“It is pretty easy to spot the "questionable" products and sellers once you're familiar with Amazon's catalog.”</i></strong>,said one Amazon consultant who whished to remain anonymous to preserve his relationship with the company.</p>
        <p>Poor photoshopping, unrealistic comments, and products with almost no information tend to indicate that security may not be in the company’s headlights. </p>
        <p><strong><i>"Before you even buy a product, you can vote with your wallet. Can passwords be changed? Does the product receive continuous updates throughout it's life? Research the company - are they known to have vulnerable products?”</i></strong>, said Morse.</p>
        <p><strong><i>"Once you do decide on a device, you can track network usage statistics with freeware applications such as Glasswire https://www.glasswire.com/. Ensure you change any settings possible for the IoT device to be as secure as possible. If you don't know what terminology means - google it! IoT devices can also be set up on a separate "Guest" SSID (but a Guest SSID needs to be set up on your router before hand).”</i></strong>, said Morse.</p>
        <p>Another major red flag to look out for is to ensure that the device has a an administrative password, authentication, and forces you to update it immediately.</p>
        <p>One could go even a step further and completely insulate their router from outside forces.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“Alternatively, a completely separate wireless network router could be set up for devices of this nature, and the router they're connected to should also be set up for automatic updates, or a consumer can set up scheduled reminders to check for updates.”</i></strong>, said Shannon.</p>

        <h2>Part V. What Companies Can Do </h2>
        <p>As consumers hopefully become more informed about the potential dangers lurking behind IoT devices, many experts in the industry have distilled down a few improvements that users should demand.</p>
        <p>The first step may just be making the devices easier to use and understand. If users can understand what choices they are making at setup, they will have a better grasp as to what a device is capable of.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“We have a serious problem with UI (user interface) just look at Alexa , or Nest thermostat , they are not easy to setup because of the limited display or no display in other word no GUI (graphical user interface )”</i></strong>, said Banafa.</p>
        <p>Another common criticism is that devices are not built with privacy in mind. Pushed updates, credential changes, and encryption should all be necessary from the onset of product development. </p>
        <p><strong><i>“Building on top of this, many devices are built on Linux, but without encryption protocols or a way for consumers to simply change default credentials. Hard coded credentials in IoT is one of the most widely used vulnerabilities for attackers.”</i></strong>, said Shannon.</p>
        <p>One consistent thread among commentators is that outside groups should be keeping tabs on these devices.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“I would require 3rd party auditing on a reoccurring basis of the product, mobile applications, and any cloud services.”</i></strong>, said Shannon.</p>
        <p><strong><i>“Yes, we need regulations to protect our SSP , without it , tech companies will not police themselves , it was clear with Facebook non-stop scandals in 2018 and 2019, and lately the revelations of a microphone in Nest devices by Google , they never mentioned that before. We need the American version of GDPR[GDPR is a European Regulation the places stiff penalties on companies that violate user privacy and gives EU members a right to their data].”</i></strong>, said Banafa.</p>

        <h2>Data Methodology</h2>
        <p>1. First, I searched “smart light bulbs” and “smart light bulb” on Amazon through a VPN. I obtained the links for pages featuring the Top 50 Brands from each of two locations. Then, I audited each page to ensure that they actually sold smart bulbs. In many cases the bulbs that were listed had advanced capabilities but were not connected to Wi-Fi. These were removed from the list. Print screen and date of the list is present in my files. The decision to stop at 66 was made due to the practical restrains of the project and the belief that only the top and most visible brands would be pertinent to consumers.</p>
        <p>2. For every search, if I found new Wi-Fi bulb brands on Amazon pages, I added them to the list. I assumed that these were products that, though not listed as a Top Brand, would appear in user’s searches.</p>
        <p>3. For every lightbulb Brand name, I methodically looked into the Amazon pages for each product and accompanying company website. Websites were found through searches on both Google and DuckDuckGo. The information I was looking for included 1.) Other Names for the Company or brand 2.) Apps Suggested by the Company to be used with the Bulbs 3.) A Privacy Policy, either for the company or for the app 4.) The company website 5.) The Last Update to the Privacy Policy. 6.) Whether the product was compatible with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Microsoft Cortana 7.) Any contact email addresses for the company. </p>
        <p>4. The requirement for Other Name was whether the other name was listed on the brand’s website or whether it appeared concurrently in Google Searches. </p>
        <p>5. Privacy Policies that did not specifically state to cover the bulbs and applications were kept in the data set. The reasoning behind this decision was that often Privacy Policies do not state explicitly what they cover or are unclear. To receive a better picture of the brand’s policy towards data retention all policies were kept. Therefore, the results of the dataset portion regarding the brand Privacy Policies must be taken with this concept in mind. My other assumption was that the average purchaser would naturally assume that the brand site’s Policy is what covered their product or would have some information indicating it as such. Therefore, it was natural to utilize this policy in all cases since this was a study based on consumer information.</p>
        <p>6. Additionally, many brands had no suggested Apps or vague references to Apps. The references were kept in the dataset, but the brands with no suggestions were noted in the data set. I later purchased many of the bulbs with no digital implication as to what apps it used, but decided to not note these Apps in the dataset. This study was made to inform the average consumer who would need the information readily available online before purchasing the device. </p>
        <p>7. Dated print screens for all of the websites, searches, and Amazon pages are also available in a separate data folder. </p>
        <p>8. For each listed app, I searched for an identical name on both the Google and Apple App Stores. I listed the Seller, Privacy Policy, Links to both stores, Last PP update, Contact Email, Notes, and Extra Information. Many products had similarly named apps from the same seller (such as iLintek). In those cases, I include the each similarly named app in the study. Notes on whether the links to the Privacy Policies actually worked were also included in the data table. </p>
        <p>9. Dated print screens for all of the app pages are available in a separate data folder. </p>
        <p>10.The brand names for each bulb were then searched in multiple Trademark Databases in order to find the Address of the Owner/Applicant, Serial #, Reg#, Filing Data, and Description for Goods and Services. Each of these was places in a spreadsheet with a link to either the Justia or WIPO page they were found on. Both of these sites are reputable and linked to the USTPO, however they have much easier web navigation.</p>
        <p>11.For each app listed, I added the last update date, version, and what Permissions it required from the Google App Store. Google makes this information easily accessible and links to these permission requirements clearly on each app page. </p>
        <p>12.I noted the date of each update for each app listed on the App Store. From my observations and data collections, the updates are only listed to the past 25.</p> 
        <p>13.For each brand and app that had an obtainable Privacy Policy, I removed the section that detailed what personal data it collected by hand. These were pasted into a separate spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>14.The spreadsheets were converted to CSVs and imported into Jupyter notebooks to be processed with Python and various additional libraries. The exact methods and processes are listed in the notebooks. Each one will be made available and feature comprehensive notation.</p>
